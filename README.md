# Predicting the Success of Pirate Attacks

This repo took shape during my Data Science course at Propulsion Academy in Zurich and was inspired by various in-class exercises. It gives a good overview of the content covered during the first month.

## Assignment Description

Following is a short description of the assignment:

>You are provided with a dataset on vessels that have been attacked by pirates. Your task is to predict whether an attack is likely to be successful.
>Clean and preprocess the data. This includes:
>- Select features.
>- One-hot encode categorical variables.
>- How do you handle the date?
>- Aggregate categories with few occurrences.
>Compare the performance of different models. Run all of them, identify the best performing one and tune it. Finally, explain how it reaches a prediction. </font>
